# Hourly Tasks

## Description
My motivation was to create a application on github to effectively time and save my tasks for specific hours of the day. I built this specific project to plan my day more accordingly and to get projects I want to complete on a hour by hour basis. It solves the problem of creating a task and adding it to the list of duties you have at your 9-5 job. I learned how to use moment.js and how to use local storage to manipulate and control my very own timetable.


## Installation

Please use the github repo to download it on to your local computer, or you can navigate it with github pages.

## Usage

You can use this by typing in the text box and saving it to your local storage, enabling you to see the tasks that you have to do for that day.
